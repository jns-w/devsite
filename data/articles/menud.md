## 
Using a digital menu in a restaurant can be a really varied experience for customers. These websites are often designed as typical web pages refitted into mobile, layouts are confusing and buttons are tiny. Whenever Iâ€™m using them, **I find myself missing the seamless experience I have in my mobile apps.**
### Goals
So my goal for this project is to have a more **app-like experience on a mobile browser**:
>- big touch points for site navigation
>- seamless page transitions, for better route sensing
>- reactive UI for conditional components i.e. carts, cart item counts

## Database design structure
Menu data is served using a golang server, with PostgresSQL as the database of choice. I have chosen to keep this simple, and not use any abstracted ORMs, opting for [SQLx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx#).\
Designed for the long term, the data is separated into tiers, and joined via IDs when being fetched; allowing reusability and adjustments to the menu in the future.
### Models
