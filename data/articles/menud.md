## 
Using a digital menu in a restaurant can be a really varied experience for customers. These websites are often designed as typical web pages refitted into mobile, layouts can be confusing and buttons tiny. Whenever Iâ€™m using them, **I find myself missing the seamless experience I have in my mobile apps.**

### Goals
So my goal for this project is to create a website that has an **app-like experience on a mobile browser**:
>#### Design requirements
> - big touch points for site navigation
> - seamless page transitions, that allows for better route sensing for the user
> - reactive UI for conditional components i.e. carts, item counts

Set your browser to mobile mode and go to the [demo](https://menud.jonaswong.dev) to experience it!

## Database design structure
Menu data is served using a golang server, with PostgresSQL as the database of choice. I have chosen to keep this simple, and not use any abstracted ORMs, opting for [SQLx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx#).\
\
Designed for the long term, the menu's data is separated into categories, and joined via IDs when being fetched; allowing reusability and adjustments to the menu in the future.

### Models
