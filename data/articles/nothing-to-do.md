I have always liked the look of clean Scandinavian typefaces, and often see great minimalistic designs based on these typefaces posted on pinterest. They are all amazing concepts, but that's about where it ends, at the conceptual stage. Looking around for completed apps in such, they were few and far between.\

So I thought why not just make one myself?
## Goals
The goal of this project is to..
ui that is intuitive to execute
as little ui elements as possible
hide ui elements until they are really needed
big touch points for ease of use

### Swiping for todo completion
### Hold todo to edit
### Press button to make a new todo
### Hold button to edit list
