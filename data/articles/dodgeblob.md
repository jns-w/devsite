While this is by no means a professional portfolio, this project holds dear to my heart as it is my first ever web project as a student. Armed with only basic understanding of javascript, I created a purely static site with a js script that uses JQuery to manipulate the DOM. 

Unaware of what's possible I experimented with creating squishy blobs and collision detection with math, storing data on objects. At the end of it I accidentally derived on a simple game-loop and, the result is an annoyingly fun game of survival.
